# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

This analysis is meant to examine ride share data for the Pyber ride share company. Using CSV files and Pandas the data has been shaped into a DataFrame. Once this was completed, the data can be cross referenced by driver type, total fare and average fares, and average fare per driver. This also allows us to create a plot to compare the total fares per month by city type.
